## Tips

* Start by creating directories for the separate domains.
* Decide which code belongs to a domain and move it to the right location (this includes moving methods/functions)
* Create your anti-corruption-layers between the domains (start with the simplest).

---

## Extra Challenge: Don't share the Product between domains

The Product is somehow a shared model. But in future the Product could be enhanced and each domain needs its own view or selected data of a Product.

* What is needed to identify a product in a domain?
* Which domain does the Printer belong to?

* Which domains did you create ?
* Which dependencies do you have finally?
* How did name the name the ports and adapters?
* What constructs hindered you?
* What do we achieve by applying a hexagonal architecture
